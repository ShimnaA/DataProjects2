**K Means Clustering**

    Data - [Generated Data using scikit learn make_blobs]

        - K means algorithm - clustered the data into 4 clusters
        - Compared result visually.
        - Checked with 2, 3, 8 clusters and visualized to get an intuition on KMeans clustering
        
    Data - [College_Data]

        - KMeans Clustering to cluster Universities into to two groups, Private and Public.
        - Some Exploratory Data Analysis done
        - Create 2 Clusters using KMeans clustering Algorithm
        - Since this is a labelled data, we can Evaluate our model. But in general case we wont have this step
